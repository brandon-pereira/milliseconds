# byte-calculator

Convert a string into bytes, kilobytes, and beyond. All from your browser!

## Why?

I thought all the alternatives weren't great.

## How?

I used some pretty basic Javascript to do the core logic.

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Fun bits (or bytes)?

I leveraged web workers to offload the heavy duty calculations to another thread. Over-engineered but this was a good chance for me to experiment.
